# ErosionIDE
A little code editor and ui engine project i am working on.

To build for linux or mac you need premake and then just run this command: premake5 gmake2 && make
To build for mac you will need command line tools and premake then run this command: premake5 gmake2 && make
To build for windows you need premake, a compiler and mingw then tun this command: premake5 gmake2 && mingw32-make
Will default to debug build.

Im still working on the engine right now, so there is not really much to see.
